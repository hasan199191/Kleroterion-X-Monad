# Kleroterion-X-Monad

Kleroterion X Monad is a Web3-enabled social GameFi platform that blends strategic voting, survival gameplay, and prediction markets to create a highly engaging decentralized experience. At its core, the game operates through "pools" of up to 100 players, where each participant pays an entrance fee to join a survival competition.

The game progresses through several phases:

Registration & Voting Phase: Players join the pool and can vote to nominate other players for potential elimination. Voting rights are limited but can be extended via purchasable voting tickets, introducing a social strategy element.

Betting Phase: Community members (players and spectators alike) can place bets on players they believe will finish as Champion or within the Top 3, Top 5, or Top 10. Each bet type has its own multiplier, and correct predictions are rewarded from the betting pool.

Elimination Phase: Based on community voting, nominated candidates are eliminated in a randomized sequence. The last remaining player is declared the Champion.

Reward Distribution: The total pool is distributed among the top 10 players based on their final ranking, with predefined percentages. Bettors who made correct predictions are also rewarded proportionally.

The projectâ€™s key goals include:

Promoting fair play and community-driven outcomes using on-chain transparency.

Encouraging social interaction and strategic alliances.

Creating sustainable reward dynamics for both players and speculators.

Exploring decentralized governance and player-influenced game mechanics.

The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure full automation, transparency, and trustless reward distribution. Revenue is generated via platform fees and ticket sales, enabling long-term scalability.
Kleroterion X Monad aims to redefine the intersection of GameFi, prediction markets, and social gaming within the Web3 ecosystem.
